          Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims,
          such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character
          traits. These aims may include the development of understanding,
          rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the
          role of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from
          indoctrination. Some theorists require that education results in an
          improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral
          definition of the term. In a slightly different sense, education may
          also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this process:

          There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving
          quality and efficiency of education towards relevance in students'
          lives and efficient problem solving in modern or future society at
          large, or for evidence-based education methodologies. A right to
          education has been recognized by some governments and the United
          Nations.[a] For example, 24 January is the International Day of
          Education.[3] At UN - level, several observance years and decades have
          been dedicated to education,[4] such as 1970 International Education
          Year.[5] Education is also one of the 17 Global Goals, where global
          initiatives aim at achieving Sustainable Development Goal 4, which
          promotes quality education for all.

          Numerous definitions of education have been suggested by theorists
          belonging to diverse fields.[6][7][8] Many agree that education is a
          purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, especially the
          transmission of knowledge.[9] But they often include other aims as
          well, such as fostering skills and character traits.[9][6][10]
          However, there are deep disagreements about the exact nature of
          education besides these general characteristics. According to some
          conceptions, it is primarily a process that occurs during events like
          schooling, teaching, and learning.[11][12][7] Others understand it not
          as a process but as the achievement or product brought about by this
          process. On this view, education is what educated persons have, i.e.
          the mental states and dispositions that are characteristic of
          them.[11][12][7] However, the term may also refer to the academic
          study of the methods and processes taking place during teaching and
          learning,
